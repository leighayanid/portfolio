description: "A website template portfolio built with Nuxt.js and Storyblok"

My former portfolio website.

This project aims to showcase the power of Nuxt.js and Storyblok.
Nuxt.js is a Vue.js framework that helps developers to easily create a server-side, single page apps, or static web page using the power of Vue. Storyblok, on the other hand, is an API-based and headless CMS that can be use on different template engines or framework of your choice such as Vue and React.

I built this, originally, to practice my CSS Grid and Flexbox skills while also mastering Nuxt.js. I later on connect to Storyblok to host data for project and blog pages.

If you're trying Nuxt and Storyblok together, you can check this project as your learning references.

Trivia: I didn't use any CSS Framework in this project. Just pure CSS Grid and Flexbox ðŸ”¥.
