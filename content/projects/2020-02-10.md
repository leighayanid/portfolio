[WIP]

Get internship and work regardless of your educational background, race, age, and/or gender.

Formerly CodeBataan (named after my home province in the Philippines), Struct is a social platform that connects developers to non-profit organizations and companies. The goal of this project is to help experienced developers to find work and for students or self-taught developers to find internship regardless of their backgrounds, be it race, age, gender and most importantly, their education.

The alpha version is up and running. You might want to check it from the link above.

This project is in active development. A lot of work to do and I mostly do all of them. If you have experience in Vue.js and if you are keen to work for social causes, feel free to contact me. Together, let's make Struct happen.
