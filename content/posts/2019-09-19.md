Hello! Thanks for visiting my blog.
It's been a while since I posted my last blog, and this time, I want to keep you updated on things that I've been working on lately.
I started my coding YouTube channel. Yes! Finally, I have my own Youtube channel. I've been thinking of having my channel on Youtube for a long time now, and I just had the guts to finally create and upload videos on my channel recently because, to be honest, I am not sure what content to put in there until one day.

# Inspiration

While browsing on Youtube feed, I saw a video from Traversy Media entitled "Why developers should have a Youtube Channel." Traversy Media is one of the most popular developers on Youtube. He has almost 600 thousand Youtube subscribers. If you're a developer, I know you know that guy. I watched the video, get insights and tried as much as possible to learn something valuable from it. Right after watching, it inspires me to launch my channel. I like how he gave personal opinions, what videos to put on your channel, and the right mindset when publishing online videos.

# Content

I was thinking of making programming tutorials, but I realized that it's time-consuming and I don't have proper gears for that. For now, I decided to show off demos of my side projects. I uploaded 2 videos, got addicted to it, and started uploading more. My content would probably focus on my personal work, I guess. But who knows, maybe in the future I could also make programming tutorials. So stay tuned!
