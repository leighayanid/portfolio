So you've finished coding your website and decided to deploy on Netlify so the world will finally see your amazing project. What you need to do next? The next step? Set up your custom domain. By default, Netlify assigns a custom subdomain to your website by giving it a random name. You can rename it later if you want. Just go to the domain section of your project and change the name of your project. Netlify subdomains usually ended with "netlify.app". So, let say you give your project "testproject" site name, your website will be available at testproject.netlify.app. You can, however, purchase a domain right on Netlify dashboard if you want to. But if you have a ready custom domain you've purchased from third party domain registrar, how can you point that domain to your Netlify website? This tutorial will teach you how to achieve that.

Here are the prerequisites to this tutorial:

### Note: For the sake of this tutorial, I will use my portfolio project as a reference.

# 1. Your Custom domain

You need to own a custom domain first before changing the domain of your project. If you have a domain ready, go to your Netlify dashboard, choose your project and click the domain button.

Now type in the domain name on custom domain name input.

As you can see, I added my custom domain alias on the list.

That's it. Next step is to get SSL certificate on Cloudflare.

# 2. Get a free SSL Certificate from Cloudflare

Let's discuss quickly what Cloudflare is and how it can help you protect your website.
