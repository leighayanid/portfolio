I've seen a lot of developers sharing their tech stack on Twitter lately. I am joining the bandwagon. Today, I will share the current tech stack I use when I build my own side projects in 2020. Spoiler: it is Javascript heavy.

## Front-end

- [ Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) - As a huge Vue.js lover, Nuxt.js is my go-to Vue framework for creating server-side rendering (SSR) apps.

- [ Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) - For static site generation. I use this for building blog site and small Vue applications.

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For UI library. A life-saver. Saves a ton of time and work for a non-designer like me.

- [ChakraUI](https://vue.chakra-ui.com/) - For UI Framework. Works well with Nuxt.js and Gridsome.

- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) - For hosting website quickly.

## Back-end

- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) - For database.

- [GraphQL](https://https://graphql.org/) - For querying API.

- [Apollo Server](https://apollo-server.com) - For creating GraphQL server. Apollo is the most popular framework to implement GraphQL client and server.

- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) - For creating and managing content and API quickly. I use this for quick prototyping. This tech is so amazing!

- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) - For building APIs quickly.

- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) - For web server hosting.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - the standard database in Heroku. Strapi and Hasura use this as a de facto database.

## Testing

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - For end to end testing.

## Tech Im curious and exploring now

I've been re-exploring the React ecosystem lately. And here is a list of tech I am excited to get hands on.

- [Redwoodjs](https://redwoodjs.com) - Bringing fullstack app to JAMStack. I love this! I tried this already and it just works!

- [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/) - Rails-like framework for React. A full-stack React framework.

This is my tech stack in a nutshell and I am very much happy to use these technologies.

Thank you for reading and ..

## Happy coding! üòÅ
